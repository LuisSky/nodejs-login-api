## **Login API** ##

 This project has created to applicated knowledges learneds with books kind `"Clean Code"` and `"Clean Archtecture"` also with code examples Medium and Youtube provides.
 
 All knowledge has applicated on my old login api for Nodejs! ( repository: <https://github.com/LuisSky/first-node-login-api> )
 
 This project is not an example of good practices or architecture, it is just a practical application of good content that I have absorbed from great tutorials and tips spread over the internet, so there is still a lot to improve and I intend to update it whenever there is a need.
